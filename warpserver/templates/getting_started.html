        To Get Started With playing Dockingstation online.<br>
        <b>First</b> you, have to install Dockingstation, It should work with all Versions including the standalone version you can get at <a href="http://www.creaturesdockingstation.com/">here</a>.<br>
        <b>Second</b>, you need an Account on AlbianWarp, get yourself one right here.<br>
        <b>Finally</b> to be able to go online you must download the <a href="/server.cfg">server.cfg</a> and place it in the main directory of DockingStation.<br>
        The server.cfg should contain the following:
        <pre><code>
"Server 0 FriendlyName" {{ server_name }}
